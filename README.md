# PoreFEM
A fortran program for the random finite element analysis of porous media 

The aim of this project is to develop a simple finite element program that (i) uses random fields to populate a cubic domain with pores and (ii) compute the reduction in stiffness of the porous material due to the presence of the pores. The code is written using subroutines published in two text books: Smith, Griffiths & Margetts, "Programming the Finite Element Method", John Wiley & Sons, 2015 and Fenton & Griffiths, "Risk Assessment in Geotechnical Engineering", John Wiley & Sons, 2008.
